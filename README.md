# Appendix 4: Machine Learning Results for Forward and Inverse Kinematics (5–9 DoF)

This repository contains the complete evaluation results of machine learning models applied to both forward and inverse kinematics for integrated C-arm fluoroscopy and multi-DoF operating table systems. The datasets span configurations from **5 DoF to 9 DoF**, and include metrics assessing model accuracy and robustness.

## Contents
- **Datasets**: Processed results for 5–9 DoF systems  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R².
- **Model Comparisons**: Linear models, ensemble methods, and deep learning architectures  

## How to Use
The results are provided in structured Excel file.  
These can be directly used for replication of the thesis findings or for further analysis.
